<li>This project is a mobile app with the intention of crowdfunding local community projects. The goal of the app is for users to walk around their neighborhood and either donate money to causes or create wells to accept incoming donations to be used for community projects such as cleaning graffiti and fixing sidewalks.</li>
<li>My contributions to the project were largely tied to the front end where I used react native to build the mobile app. I also integrated redux, stripejs and mapbox into creating the app.</li>
<li>The current outcome of this project is that our team was able to release it and get it onto the Google Play Store since we focused largely on building the app on Android first. The next step will be to also get it running on IOS devices.</li>

<ul>
<li>One of the categories in the NASA hackathon was beach safety and so our group built this web application using vanilla javascript which retrieves local government beach data. The data is then displayed on a map tied to the various beaches of Oahu, Hawaii. The data consists of live weather, wind, temperature, surf and general advisories for each specific beach. Users can click on any beach and see the latest current information about that location.</li>
<li>I contributed largely on the front-end javascript as well as the integration of the google map API. My task was to take the government data, parse it, and then display it on the map according to the correlated beach.</li>
<li>The project is fully functional and does what it is supposed to do which is give users information. The next step would be to increase the amount of data to include more safety information for users.</li>

I learned to communicate better with others as related to projects but also as real world relationships. Another huge benefit of DevLeague is that I now have the confidence to learn on my own through better techniques and helpful instruction.</h4>
